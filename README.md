This Java program implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the console.

Key Features:

Two-Player Gameplay: Allows two players (X and O) to take turns making moves.

Game Board: Represents the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Input Handling: Prompts players for their moves (row and column numbers) and handles invalid inputs (out-of-bounds numbers, non-numeric input, or already taken positions).

Win Condition Detection: Automatically checks for a win condition after each move for both rows, columns, and diagonals.

Draw Detection: Determines if the game has ended in a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.

Clear Game State: Maintains and updates the game's state (playing, X wins, O wins, draw).

User Interface: Displays the current state of the board after each move and announces the game's outcome.
